	Little BM is a simple DIY portable microcontroller based FM synthesizer designed to be simple, cheap and easy to build, with a variety of sounds to play with. 
	
	It can be powered by a 9 volt battery or a 9v DC psu.

	Little BM uses bitwise (OR and XOR)frequency modulation with a sync mode to produce a wide variety of sounds. 
	
	It has a simple LF0 with frequency control and 4 wavforms at 2 resolution rates (lower res waves for faster frequencies). 
	
	It has tremelo control with waveform inversion and vibrato with 4 bit PAM (pulse amplitude modulation) linear output. 
	
	The design has a line level/headphone output and a speaker output powered by a lm386 audio amplifier.
